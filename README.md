Welcome to VirtuWill! This project aims to create a secure, automated solution for transferring digital assets upon the owner’s death, using blockchain technology to ensure transparency, privacy, and protection against fraud. By combining multi-party verification, a death certificate, and time-locked transfer, it offers peace of mind to asset owners and their beneficiaries, reducing the need for intermediaries and ensuring assets are passed on as intended.

Specifically, this project leverages blockchain, IPFS, and encryption to securely manage and transfer digital assets after the owner’s death. An encrypted will is stored on IPFS, ensuring that sensitive information remains private and accessible only to designated beneficiaries. The smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain enforces multi-layered security checks, including multi-party approval, a verified death certificate upload, and a time-lock mechanism, to confirm the owner's passing before decrypting and transferring the assets. By combining decentralized storage, cryptographic encryption, and smart contract automation, this solution offers a transparent, tamper-proof, and secure approach to inheritance without intermediaries.

Team Info: Our team is driven by a passion for better planning and forward-thinking solutions that empower individuals and their loved ones. We are dedicated to blending a better future by leveraging modern technology to solve real-life challenges around asset inheritance and security. With expertise in blockchain, cryptography, and decentralized storage, we aim to create innovative tools that offer peace of mind and control, helping people protect what matters most in a transparent, secure, and privacy-preserving way.
